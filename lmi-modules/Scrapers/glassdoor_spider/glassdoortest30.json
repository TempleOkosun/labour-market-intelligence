You will need to have NO Outstanding County Court Judgements\u2019 a full UK driving licence and no past criminal record. <br><br><strong>The role:</strong><br><br> The work is predominantly focussed on engagement with customers, problem solving, collections and suits those with commitment and a desire to work hard in an environment that can offer a lot of flexibility in hours and can provide significant earnings potential for those that are focussed, committed, hardworking and have the right overall work ethic. There are also excellent opportunities for career progression in this sector. <br><br> Judicial services work is from large central government departments and local Government who contract out many of their activities to private companies. <br><br><strong>Enforcement Agent role:</strong><br><br> Enforcement agent roles are the front line of judicial services. <br><br> An enforcement agent is legally qualified (called certificated) to execute any order that a court (civil or criminal) passes onto them. They have significant powers to \u2018Take Control of Goods\u2019 and undertake other court related action. <br><br> In order to become a certificated agent, you will need to become skilled and pass a number of key industry related skills to NVQ or equivalent levels. <br><br> \u00b7 Data protection and information security <br><br> \u00b7 Vulnerability <br><br> \u00b7 Legal aspects of relevant legal acts (Tribunal Courts and Enforcement Act 2007) <br><br> \u00b7 Risk assessments and H&amp;S <br><br> This whole process forms part of your initial training and is paid for by the company. <br><br><strong>Would it suit you?</strong><br><br> The majority of enforcement agent roles will be front line and obtaining successful outcome to a legal court order. This in the main, will be debt based. The most common types of court order are: <br><br> \u00b7 Criminal fines that defendants have not paid <br><br> \u00b7 Arrest warrant for fines that defendants have failed to pay/appear in court <br><br> \u00b7 Liability orders for Council tax debts <br><br> \u00b7 Liability orders for Business rates where companies have defaulted on payments <br><br> \u00b7 Traffic management fines that are due to Local Authorities <br><br> All of these types of roles in the field are debt based. Companies would therefore look for the following basic skill sets as being required initially: <br><br> \u00b7 A confident but calm disposition <br><br> \u00b7 Ability to negotiate and be a clear and concise communicator <br><br> \u00b7 Be able to use standard tablet technology <br><br> \u00b7 Remain calm under pressure <br><br> \u00b7 Excellent work ethic <br><br> \u00b7 Ability to work on your own or as part of a team. <br><br> \u00b7 Well organised and self disciplined <br><br> Companies would also look for these backgrounds as desirable: <br><br> \u00b7 Ex-military, a soldier or a role in the British Army for the Ministry of Defence or any ex-forces position <br><br> \u00b7 Current Military but transitioning. e.g. security or close protection, warrant officer <br><br> \u00b7 Sales background <br><br> \u00b7 Door step work, collections, field or other <br><br> \u00b7 Police <br><br> \u00b7 Prison or Border Force e.g. immigration <br><br> \u00b7 Security <br><br><strong>The role details:</strong><br><br> You will be working in the field. This means travel within an hour of your home base. You will be dealing with the persons named on the court order, identifying them and helping them solve the issue of the warrant or order. This can be difficult, and some are persistent offenders are apt at non-compliance. <br><br> Less than 1% of warrants and orders actually result in goods being taken into control. <br><br><strong>Role assistance</strong><br><br> The company from which you contract yourself to, will provide you with all the necessary tools. Handheld tablet device, discreet body worn video camera badge and of course all of the necessary skill sets and knowledge you need such as your legal rights. <br><br><strong>Self-employed and PAYE</strong><br><br> Most enforcement agent roles are self-employed, on a commission-based basis, but not all. The self-employed roles suit those who require flexibility in managing their time and are happy to be responsible for their own time and records management and the ability to work across multiple work roles. <br><br> Richardson Bailey provide a fully qualified accountant who will set up any HMRC initial work regarding tax codes and record keeping as a free, up-front service. <br><br> With self-employment comes the requirement to be results driven, being able to manage your time and plan accordingly and be dedicated to the role.

We provide e-learning awareness, mentoring, industry contacts, and a personalised and bespoke service to a prospective candidate. We provide an up-front, honest and open and clear understanding of the sector for you. <br><br> We are not a purveyor or processor of CV\u2019s and every candidate will be contacted personally at each point of the process. <br><br> Not all work is equal. <br> Your performance and your earnings will be based on many factors, not least the location\u2019s you work in and the volume your company issue to you as a contractor. Some work will undoubtedly be better quality than others. <br><br> Contracts from government departments can move between companies and so commission structures can change. <br><br> Richardson Bailey have industry and sector knowledge that will help you be placed in the right role for you. <br><br> Only when you are fully conversant with that will we consider recommending and placing you with a company, throughout your journey you will be personally managed by industry experts. <br><br> We will not just pass a CV over until we are 100% sure the role is the correct one for you.</div>"], "Date_Posted": "2018-07-11", "Valid_Till": "", "Industry": "", "Time_Crawled": "Thu Jul 12 03:49:23 2018", "Data_Source": "glassdoor.co.uk"},
